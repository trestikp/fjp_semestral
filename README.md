# FJP semestral
- supposed theme: PL/0 compiler with simple IDE in JS/ web
- the first draft grammar seems too simple - can it work? should it include various types?
- TODO: calling a procedure with params example is wrong (doesn't take the parameters)

TURN-IN CHECKLIST:
- integer:
    - [x] \+
    - [x] \-
    - [x] \*
    - [x] /
    - [x] =
    - [x] \#
    - [x] <
    - [x] <=
    - [x] \>
    - [x] \>=
- float:
    - [x] \+
    - [x] \-
    - [x] \*
    - [x] /     - only works "somewhat" (it seems periodic numbers don't work e.g.: 1/3)
    - [x] =
    - [x] \#
    - [x] <
    - [x] <=
    - [x] \>
    - [x] \>=
- boolean:
    - [x] ~
    - [x] &
    - [x] |
    - [x] =
    - [x] \#
- string:
    - [ ] \+
    - [ ] =
    - [ ] \#
- [x] if
- [x] else
- [x] while
- [x] for
- [x] return value - tested integer only (TODO: test other data types)
- [ ] multiple assignment
- [x] parallel assignment
- [ ] expression priority with ()
- [ ] parameters? (not even done)
- [ ] ternary? (not even done - doesn't have much use)
- [x] AND, OR, NEG (in some basic form)
